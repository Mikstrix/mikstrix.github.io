# Pokémon TCG Pocket Luck Calculator

A fun, web-based calculator for Pokémon TCG Pocket that measures how “lucky” your pack pulls are based on in-game probabilities. The app features a retro, Pokémon-themed design with dynamic animations and confetti effects to celebrate your pulls (or commiserate when luck isn’t on your side).
